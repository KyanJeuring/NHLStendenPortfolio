    //Logical XOR - only 1 of the conditions have to be met in order to result in a TRUE. However if both conditions are met
    //it will result in a FALSE.
    if($foo == 0 XOR $bar == 1){}

    //Logical ! (pronounced NOT) - will invert the result of the condition. TRUE will become False, and vice versa.
    //Can be used in correlation with functions that result TRUE or FALSE.
